/*
 * = Stackless Async Subroutines =
 *
 * Taking inspiration from protothreads and async/await as found in C#, Rust and JS,
 * this is an async/await implementation for C based on Duff's device.
 *
 * Features:
 *
 * 1. Subroutines can have persistent state that isn't just static state, because
 *    each async subroutine accepts its own struct it uses as a parameter, and
 *    the async state is stored there.
 * 2. Because of the more flexible state handling, async subroutines can be nested
 *    in tree-like fashion which permits fork/join concurrency patterns.
 *
 * Caveats:
 *
 * 1. Due to compile-time bug, MSVC requires changing: 
 *      Project Properties > Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General > Debug Information Format
 *    from "Program Database for Edit And Continue" to "Program Database".
 * 2. As with protothreads, you have to be very careful with switch statements within an async
 *    subroutine. Generally best to avoid them.
 * 3. As with protothreads, you can't make blocking system calls and preserve the async semantics.
 *    These must be changed into non-blocking calls that test a condition.
